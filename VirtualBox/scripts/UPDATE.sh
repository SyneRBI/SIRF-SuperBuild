# Script to install/update the SyneRBI VM. It could also be used for any
# other system but will currently change your .bashrc.
# This is to be avoided later on.
#
# Check the process_options function in UPDATE_functions.sh for usage.
#
# Warning: if you use a local branch (as opposed to a remote branch or a tag), this
# script will merge remote updates automatically, without asking.
#
# See also update_VM.sh. That script is the one you would normally call.
# Calling the current script is only safe to create a new SIRF-SuperBuild.
