This is a virtual machine with pre-installed versions of the CCP SyneRBI
software SIRF and associated utilities.

Check https://github.com/SyneRBI/SyneRBI_VM/wiki for more information.

To get all software up-to-date, type

   update_VM.sh

To run MR demos, first open a new terminal and type

    gadgetron

Then open another terminal, change to 

    cd $SIRF_PATH/examples/Python

and check some of the examples (some info is in the README.md). 

There are also examples for MATLAB, but MATLAB is not installed on this VM of course.

You can use SyneRBI Virtual Machine as a Gadgetron server if you cannot 
install Gadgetron on you computer (we ourselves have not yet succeeded in 
installing it under Windows). For this, you need to set up communication 
between your computer and VM in the following manner.

* Start Virtual Machine.

* Forward port 9002 to VM (in Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager: go to Settings->Network, click on Port Forwarding, add new forwarding rule by clicking on +, set Host Port and Guest Port to 9002).

* Open a new Linux terminal on VM and type 'gadgetron' there.

This will enable you to run SIRF MR demos on your computer.
