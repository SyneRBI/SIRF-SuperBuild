# Updating the VM
In most cases, typing `update_VM.sh` in a terminal will be sufficient to update the software. However, for some upgrades, extra system or Python packages can be required which were not preinstalled on the VM of a previous version. You can install these by adding the `-s` argument to the update command: `update_VM.sh -s`. We recommend running `sudo apt update` before this. In essence, `update_VM.sh -s` will run the following:

```sh
cd ~/devel/SyneRBI_VM
git pull
cd scripts
sudo -H ./INSTALL_prerequisites_with_apt-get.sh
sudo -H ./INSTALL_python_packages.sh
sudo -H ./INSTALL_CMake.sh
./configure_gnome.sh
update_VM.sh
```

If you have changed any of your `*-Exercises` or `CIL_demos` folders, you might want to use the
`update_with_backup_for_exercises.sh` script instead, which will first move your
exercises to a time-stamped back-up folder.

## VM for specific training events
In some cases, we create a VM for a specific training school. The configuration for such an event will be on a specific branch. For instance for the Synergistic Reconstruction training school November 2019, please do the following before the `git pull` mentioned above
```sh
git fetch
git checkout Symposium2019
