## v3.3.1

   - installs custom pip and all python prerequisites with pip
   - Bugfix in finding cython and python in UPDATE.sh
   - general refresh of scripts etc
   - move `zero_fill.sh` from `first_run.sh` and move it to a new `clean_before_VM_export.sh` script, which also removes build files to make the exported VM smaller.
- docker and VM:
   - install `uuid-dev` such that we're prepared for installing ROOT
   - no longer force numpy<=1.20
- CMake:
   - FindCython allows hints

- Moved the VM scripts etc to this repo
- CMake: removed USE_SYSTEM_siemens_to_ismrmrd
- CMake: added required versions for STIR, NIFTYREG, ISMRMRD.
- Drop Python 2 support
- CMake minimum required version is set to 3.16.2, as it supports Boost 1.72
- VirtualBox VM is created from the SIRF-SuperBuild repository
- Docker images install CIL via conda, so setting `BUILD_CIL=OFF` in the docker build
- Added jupyterhub Dockerfile and documentation to build the jupyterhub image used in training on top of SIRF docker images and jupyter datascience-notebook image with GPU access.
- Adds Boost random for ISMRMRD 1.5.0 [#636](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-SuperBuild/issues/636)
- moved the VM repository to the `VirtualBox` subdirectory
- fix usage of `proj_EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS` facility (it was broken for all projects except ITK) [#616](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-SuperBuild/issues/616)

- GTest: if USE_SYSTEM_GTest=OFF, attempt to force finding our version, otherwise, pass GTest_DIR or GTEST_ROOT on to dependent projects.
- add the CERN ROOT library (if USE_ROOT=ON, but defaults to OFF), which can be used by STIR to read GATE ROOT files.
- updated versions:
  - CMake: 3.16.2
  - ISMRMRD: 1.7.0 if siemens_to_ismrmrd is built, 1.4.2.1 otherwise

  - ITK: 5.2.1 However, we now build a smaller set of modules,
     most (but not all) of IO, and Filtering. See SuperBuild/External_ITK.cmake)
  - NiftyReg: 99d584e2b8ea0bffe7e65e40c8dc818751782d92 ) (fixes gcc-9 OpenMP problems)

## v3.1.1

- added external project astra-python-wrapper to allow updates of ASTRA without conflicts [#605](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-SuperBuild/issues/605)
- fix docker/entrypoint for case where a user has a GID that already exists in the Docker image [#606](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-SuperBuild/issues/606)

## v3.1.0
- docker:
  - configure nbstripout in SIRF-Exercises for `sirf-service`
  - major change w.r.t. users and permissions. We now build as user `jovyan` (by default)
    and still switch to `sirfuser` for running the container. This avoids having to
    reset permissions of many files, and therefore speeds-up container start-up.
  - introduced `SIRF_SB_URL`, `SIRF_SB_TAG` and `NUM_PARALLEL_BUILDS`. They default to the
    values used before (i.e. resp. the main `SIRF-SuperBuild` repo, `master` and `2`).
  - add dependencies that are available only from conda-forge (for CIL)
  - improved documentation
- allow specifying `HDF5_URL` and `HDF5_TAG` like for other projects
- updated versions:
  - SIRF: 3.1.0
  - CIL: 21.2.0
  - CIL-ASTRA: 21.2.0
- disable built of NiftyPET by default as our current setup  requires Python2 for which we dropped support
- Continuous Integration testing:
    - Removed all Travis runs except those that run docker

## v3.0.0
- use BUILD_CIL=ON for all Docker builds
- Docker build moved to Python3 only.
- Environment files with name env_sirf.sh (and csh) are created. Symbolic links or copies with the previous name env_ccppetmr.sh (and csh) depending on the version of CMake available are made.
- Fix some issues with finding Python [#472](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-SuperBuild/issues/472)
- Handling dependent projects:
    - Sets `USE_ITK=ON` by default.
    - Disabled building of `Module_ITKReview` by default
    - Updates for CIL 20.11+ which has a different python module structure. CCPi-FrameworkPlugins has been also removed.
    - CIL repository has been transferred to the TomographicImaging organisation; reflect changes in CIL repositories
    - Patch Gadgetron include file hoNDFFT.h to remove spurious ".."
    - Add Gadgetron as a dependency of SIRF if `BUILD_Gadgetron` is `ON`.
    - Enabled HDF5 support for STIR by default (build C++ libraries for HDF5)
    - Add option `BUILD_TESTING_JSON` (default OFF)
- Updated versions:
   - JSON: 3.9.1
   - SWIG: 4.0.2
   - STIR: 4.1.1
   - SIRF: 3.0.0
   - CIL: 21.1.0
   - CCPi-Regularisation toolkit: 20.09
- Continuous Integration testing:
    - Add GitHub actions and removed most Travis runs
